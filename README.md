# automata

The goal of this package is to enable simple and fast simulation and visualization of finite automata.

## Tasks

* Get the back end simulation working for the following automata

  * Deterministic finite automata
  * Nondeterministic finite automata
  * Deterministic pushdown automata
  * Nondeterministic pushdown automata
  * Deterministic Turing machine
  * Nondeterministic Turing machine

* Refactor the code to be more general
* Work on the front end visualization in Javascript

  * State placement to make it look good

## Ideas

This is where I am putting ideas that I'm having while I'm figuring out the design I want.

* If I implement a multitape TM, then I automatically get every other finite automata.
